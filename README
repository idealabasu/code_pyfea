### Scipy workaround for windows:

>I had exactly the same issue. Found the solution here: https://bitbucket.org/anthony_tuininga/cx_freeze/issues/43/import-errors-when-using-cx_freeze-with
>
> Find the hooks.py file in cx_freeze folder. Change line 548 from finder.IncludePackage("scipy.lib") to finder.IncludePackage("scipy._lib").
>
> Leave the "scipy" entry in packages and delete 'C:\Python34\Lib\site-packages\scipy' in include_files.

### If there is a problem with cKDTree and ckdtree:
in lib/site-packages/scipy/spatial/__init__.py, comment out:

from ckdtree import *

> I was able to fix the problem by making a small change to cx_Freeze/windist.py. In add_config(), line 61, I changed:

>                 None, None, None, None)])
